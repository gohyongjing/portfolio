        JLK is my second internship, a medical tech company that helps simplify medical processes by providing a platform for tele consultation and kiosks to speed up the process of collecting patient&apos;s vitals.

        This internship gave me a solid foundation of many different aspects of software engineering, from Javascript frontend, FastAPI backend, end-to-end testing as well as continuous integration and delivery. Besides common tasks like building tables on frontend and API endpoints on the backend, I also got to do other cool stuff like integrating external video call service (100ms) and other business to business API integration. Some of code structure I designed in JLK, such as assigning error codes to each failure point, was so useful and widely applicable that I even brought it to my next internship (I&apos;m writing this way after my internship at JLK ended)

        To all my friends at JLK - Yappers Yanni and Ariel, Jay, Jonas, Cedric, Gang Wei, Vaishnavi, Ze Ming, Aaron, Caleb, Zoe and David -  Very thankful for all of you for making this a wonderful and memorable experience! Your presence in office, your insights, your yapping and our lunch breaks together provided me a positive experience and made work much more enjoyable! I even look forward to going to office sometimes! Ya&apos;ll made me grow as a person, becoming a better software engineer and more importantly, a better friend (I hope!). I&apos;m grateful to have kept in touch with some of ya&apos;ll and hope I can continue to do so!
